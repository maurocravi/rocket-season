    {
        question: "How do I get the Season Rewards?",
        answer: "You must win 10 matches at a rank to secure that rank's rewards. For example, to get Diamond rewards, you need to reach Diamond rank AND win 10 games while at Diamond rank (after securing lower rank wins).",

        question: "Will my rank reset next season?",

        question: "What are the Season 21 rewards?",
        answer: "Psyonix usually announces rewards a few weeks before the season ends. We will update this page as soon as they are revealed.",
